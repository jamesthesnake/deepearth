# DeepEarth: Geospatial Deep Simulator of Earth's Ecosystems

This repository supports the development of **DeepEarth**, a deep neural network for modeling Earth's ecosystems at landscape scale.  DeepEarth will directly support prediction of plant-pollinator interactions, as well as plant-fire and plant-flood ecohydrology, across California and Florida.  Its development is led by Ecodash.ai, Stanford University, and University of Florida, with support from NSF.

DeepEarth learns from biological, geological, and ecological data ‚Äì e.g., species presence records, satellite imagery, 3D topography, soil surveys, and climate models ‚Äì across space and time. It learns by reconstructing partially or fully masked data, sampled around (x, y, z, t) coordinates of scientific records. Prior knowledge from validated scientific models guides optimization as Bayesian constraints.

Initial prototype results are expected by a DeepEarth workshop on June 17th, 2025, sponsored by NSF I-GUIDE in Chicago.  The prototype will focus on simulating flowering and pollination in native ecosystems of California and Florida between 2010 to 2025. Predictive accuracy will initially be validated through (i) _in silico_ accuracy of predicted plant-pollinator distributions vs. real observations
unseen during model training, and eventually by (ii) planting field trials seeking to maximize native plant & pollinator biodiversity, flowering abundance, and cross-pollination.
